# free-code-camp-js-lectures-exercises

Saturday, October 23, 2021 
Initialized this repository in order to gain practice at using git hub. 
At this time I have made a JavaScript file  in which I will begin working on exercises that I come across from Free Code Camp dot org. 

The tutorial that I aim to complete, which I have deemed necessary due to my lack of understanding on Nested Loops, can be located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nesting-for-loops-in-javascript/. 

 Buy the end of this tutorial I aim to have a better understanding of how to access nested the elements of a nested variable and maniuplate it. 

 Observations: In my CSX Prep Course 2, I am currently stuck in a nested loop exercise. I have had a difficult time when getting to the implementation of my innerloop. Specifically, I haven't been able to figure out how to push the string "loop#" at the right time. 
 




This will be now my first commit.
